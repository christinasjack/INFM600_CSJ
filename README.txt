The focal data set here is a .csv file listing pools in the Columbia Association from Howard County. Citation: Howard County. (2014). Pools – Columbia Association [.csv file]. Available from https://data.howardcountymd.gov/ Date accessed: October 12, 2015 

The focal data set is a list of the 24 pools run by the Columbia Association.  The data set includes a record ID, name, street address, city, zip code, and coordinates for each pool.  The pools are located in the cities of Clarksville, Columbia, Ellicott City, and Laurel.

Two other data sets that could feasibly be combined with the ones related to my project are day care centers in Howard County and elementary schools in Howard County.  These data sets can be joined together on location.  They can also be joined to Pools – Columbia Association on location.  

The day care centers data set includes a record ID, name, street address, city, zip code, and coordinates for each day care center.  The day care centers are located throughout Howard County.

The elementary schools data set includes a record ID, name, street address, city, zip code, and coordinates for each elementary school.  The elementary schools are located throughout Howard County.

Many Generation X and Millennials have children in day care centers and elementary schools.  These parents see one another daily at day care center/elementary school drop-off and pickup.  Since they have children in the same age group, they are likely exchange ideas for family activities such as pool membership.  Presumably, some parents are members of the CA and others are not, therefore these organizations would be terrific place to begin a word of mouth peer referral campaign for CA pools.  

In addition, many of these elementary schools and daycares likely have social media pages. The CA could provide content about the nearest pool(s) to each day care center and elementary school to be posted on the organization’s social media pages.  And, the CA could provide content to parents to share with other parents online.  

The question that this data set could answer is: Which CA pool is closest to each day care center and elementary school?  Answering this question would allow the CA to provide details about the nearest pool to each day care center and elementary school and to identify CA members at each day care center and elementary school who could help spread the word about the features of the pool.

There are two ways that I will want to analyze this data for each pool.  First, for each CA pool I would like a list of the schools and daycares closer to that pool than any other CA pool.  Next, I will want a map of all pools, day cares, and elementary schools.  After I see this map, I will likely want to break it into smaller neighborhood maps for each day care center and pool.
